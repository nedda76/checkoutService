A checkout application for a Shopping Cart
==========================================

This application exposes a RESTful API with one end-point which provides checkout functionality for the Shopping Cart
of a store.

It can be called via any REST client in this way:

http://localhost:9000/total/orange,apple

The only items it recognises are orange and apple separated by commas as shown, case insensitive.
